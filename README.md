# Semantic UI with React Demo

This project was created by a React newbie; [suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/issues/new) greatly appreciated.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This project was originally bootstrapped from the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) starter app. Then we discovered the [React Semantic UI Starter](https://github.com/Metnew/react-semantic.ui-starter) which, although less polished (clone a repo and remove its `.git` subdirectory vs. run an application), does *so much more* of what we're going to need to wrap our heads around that it seemed worth starting "from scratch" again. And there is *a lot* to learn:

1. More components that we can easily ~~copy~~adapt to our purposes;
2. Webpack FTW;
3. A JSON server as a mock DB backend;
4. React Router;
5. Redux in all its purported glory;
6. Progressive Web App features like offline operation;
7. And [*tons* more!](https://github.com/Metnew/react-semantic.ui-starter/blob/dev/package.json)

All stuff we know we *need* to learn and use. Arguably, it's easier to poke around starting from a point where all of the above is known to work, so when it breaks, it's because we broke it (as opposed to "we didn't get it right the first time"). The next few days<sup>1</sup> are going to be the acid test of that assertion. 

<sup>1</sup> Terms and conditions apply, of course; consider the geocultural source. 

## Installation and Use

After cloning *this* repo, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Metnew/react-semantic.ui-starter#usage) in the original bootstrap repo. Wherever they mention `npm`, read that as "`npm` or its equivalent `yarn` invocation".


## Development, aka Kibitzing

As I mentioned at the start, I'm new to React (and relatively new to modern JavaScript); if you want to start a discussion about something, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/issues/new) and tell me (and the rest of the Peanut Gallery) what's on your mind. If you see code that could be written better, documented better, and/or tested better, pull requests are *very* welcome. Am I doing something suboptimally? Want to show off the Semantic UI Components for React in a way that others can learn something useful from? PR away, then. :simple_smile:

Whether opening an issue or a PR, I'd appreciate it if you'd use the [label(s)](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels) relevant to what you'd like to do or discuss. Some of these labels, likely the most appropriate for new issues, are:

* Please tag an issue or PR with [react](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/react) when the point of the issue/PR Is the way that the React API and components are being used *specifically to React or to the Semantic UI Components for React*; if this isn't also a *bug*, then it probably has to do with my misunderstanding of the API or components. Thanks for helping me learn;
* A [bug](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/bug) is a defect or error in an artefact of *this* project &mdash; our code, tests, or documentation. It's not a React problem; it's my (or our) screw-up, and you'd like to point it out and (hopefully) help fix it;
* A [documentation](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/documentation) issue is just that: an error or omission in this document (or other supporting docs that you feel ought to be here). See a typo? Is some bit of doc incorrect or misleading? Simply see room for improvement? Thanks for helping out with a *documentation*-tagged PR;
* An [enhancement](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/enhancement) is a suggestion for improvement of a specific artefact. This includes either refactoring or adding new functionality to an existing component;
* An issue marked "[help wanted](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/help%20wanted)" declares that one of us has *part* of an idea, or the basics of an idea but we're unsure of how to proceed further;
* A [question](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/question) is an *issue* that differs from "help wanted" in that (usually) I'm asking an open-ended question and asking for others to help brainstorm before we turn it into a PR;
* Please don't create any issues or PRs which *you* tag as [invalid](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/invalid). Pointless, no?
* An issue or PR tagged [`WIP`](https://github.com/jdickey/suirdemo/labels/WIP) is one that is expected to take several iterations of discussion and coding to be able to finalise. Think of this as *research towards a goal.*
